# pick-an-affirmation
Fun way to creatively pick an affirmation!
## Details
1. How would you describe the inputs of your app? 
  * What goes in? What data does your app take in from the user, if any? Will it get data from a database or from a third-party service?
    * App later on will take an input on what area of life people are seeking an affirmation
    * For now, App will get a selection from the user of a card or rather a color first, then a flower. Based on that the database will provide a matching affirmation.
2. How would you describe the outputs or possible outcomes of your app? 
  * Based on those inputs, what does the app display to the user? What are some of the outcomes or results that your app produces based on how the user interacts with it?
    * App displays an affirmation
    * User can try again
3. What would you store as variables in your JavaScript file for the first prototype of your app? 
  * What does the computer need to remember between when the user starts the app and when they close the page?*
    * The color selected
    * The flower selected
4. Which kinds of data types are these inputs/variables? 
  * Are they strings of text? Numbers? Boolean values (true or false)?
    * String - color and flower
